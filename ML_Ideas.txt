class GameBoard<T> {
    List<List<T>> 2dVector
}

 
machine learning algorithm:
detective ai plays mrX ai many times until they git gud

mrX
neural network inputs parser:
List<GameBoard<bool>> locations
List<List<TicketCount>> tickets //count of each ticket of each player
int mrXMovesLeft
GameBoard<bool> possibleMoves
GameBoard<TicketOneHotEncode> ticketRequiredForMove  

neural network output:
GameBoard<bool> outputMove

reward function:
win = good
lose = bad
