ScotlandYard manual
===================

Welcome to the ScotlandYard manual. 

The is a minimalistic turn-based implementation of the ScotlandYard 
Game with the features including:

 * Mr.X travel log
 * Ticket counter
 * Visual ticket picker
 * Extensible AI 
 
**Exclusions**
 
Police are excluded for simplicity. 

### Game setup

When the game starts, a setup screen will appear that allows you to 
configure the game. 
There are two tabs, in the `Player settings` tab, you may configure 
the following:

 * Name
 * Starting location
 * AI
 * Tickets
 
If no name is specified, the colour of the player is used.
The starting location defaults to random, locations are also 
mutually exclusive between all players. AI defaults to none, 
which means a human player will have to pick a move on the board.

The second tab call `Round settings` allows you to modify game 
configurations listed below

 * Timeout
 * Round count
 * Reveal rounds
 
Timeout controls how long a player can decide when selecting a move.
If the player fails to select a move then the opposite side wins.

Round count controls how many rounds the game have, the default is 24 
rounds. Reveal rounds control whether Mr.X's location will be shown on
Mr.X's travel log and the board.

### Game play

Mr.X is always the first to play. When a player is required to make a move, 
a small notification box that contains a timer will appear on the top, the 
board will then circle locations that are available to the player. Players
should pick a location to move to by clicking on the circles and then select
which ticket to use to complete the move.
